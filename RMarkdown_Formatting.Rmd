### Results
I am interested in the 'mpg' variable along with the 'vs' variable. I want to display mpg on a scatterplot and t-test results comparing mpg for vs values of 0 and 1. My null hypothesis would be the mpg for both vs groups are equal.  


As weight increased trend appears to result in decreased mpg. Below is correlation of mpg and weight relationship.  
`r cor(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)`.

Below are results of T-test mentioned earlier. My null hypothesis would be the mpg for both vs groups are equal.  
```{r table_created}
cat(readLines("../../static/Results/ttest.txt"), sep="\n")
```

## Conclusion  
Based on such a low p-value I reject the null hypothesis. The data does not suggest that vs equal to 0 has the same mpg as vs equal to 1. vs equal to 1 has a much larger average mpg than vs equal to 0.
